# Software Proposal Form
- Your name: Connor Moore
- Your project title: X,Y Soundscape
# Describe the theme or key idea behind your project
To use the X,Y movements of a mouse with a grid system to create a soundscape of various sounds such as synth waves, drums and guitars. 
Unlike the piano or guitar, users will experience a basic UI that allows them to create a simple drum beat.  
# Project research
The main focus is based on PlOrk and SLOrk, a group of composers using laptops, controllers, and speakers to create music. I will also be focusing on Vector synthesis. This is where I can use a variety of envelopes and create different tones depending on which oscillator the user has moved the pin to. If I were to use any hardware, I would be using the Yamaha TG33, otherwise I will be using SuperCollider.

# Project development
The user will see a grid with a moveable pin in the center. When the user moves the pin around the grid, the tempo, pitch, frequency, and synths will alter the beat. This will allow the user to create a unique drum beat. The user will not need experience (virtuosity) with drums so this makes this project accessible to all users. 
## What do you anticipate them to hear?
A mixture of synth-based drums.
## How will they interact with your software?
Mouse
## What unique features does your software offer them?
Showcasing an array of drums within a grid. The user will be able to move the pin around the grid and experience a variety of drum samples mixed with each other.
